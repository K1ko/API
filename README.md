# API
### What is an API? I am going to talk about what is an API and why is it good for.
## WHAT IS AN API?
`API` Stands for `Application Programming Interface` , which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. \

`Daily Example of API` \
Imagine you are sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from `system`. 
The kitchen is the part of the `SYSTEM` that will prepare your order.\
What is missing is the part to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table.\
That is where the waiter or `API` comes in.

The waiter is the `messenger` or the `API` that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you ,in this case the food.\

To recapitulate `API` takes your request and tells the `system` what to do. Then the `API` delivers the response back to you.\
To sum up an `API` allows different softwares talk with each-other sharing data requests and much more.
